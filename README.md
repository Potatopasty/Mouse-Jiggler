# Mouse Jiggler
This is super simple mouse jiggler for digispark or any ATTiny85 to fool your employer to think you are awake on those Teams meetings. 

This sketch will move mouse cursor 2 pixels right and 2 pixels left at 30 seconds interval.

Some digisparks refuse to work in some USB-ports. If this is the case, laptop docking station or usb hub will most likely solve the problem.
